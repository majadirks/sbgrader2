Gradebook format:
  (i) LT assignments in format 'LT1A Brief Description' (start with 'LT' and then a code of some sort, with no space in between, then a space, then a brief description)
  (ii) Assignment for overall grade that contains the word 'overall' and does not start with 'LT' (e.g. 'Overall LT Grade' is okay)
    (Feature for putting score history in reports not currently available)
  (iii) Comments may contain previous scores in in the following formats:
              'Previous scores: 1, 2.5, 3'
              'Previous scores: 1 2.5 3'
              'Previous scores: 1 (5/28 - try again!), 2.5 3'
              'Previous scores: 1 (5/28), 2.5 (6/1 - getting there!!!), 3 Good job :)'
              'Previous: 1, 2.5, 3'
        Program will look for 'Previous scores:' or 'Previous:',
        and then try to parse scores. 
        It will ignore anything in parentheses. Commas and/or spaces
        separate scores. If it encounters an invalid character outside of
        parentheses, it assumes the score list is over.
