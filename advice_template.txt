# This file contains advice to give students in a few different situations.
# For example, it contains advice for students who have As but have
# not yet met all LTs, or for students who have Bs because they
# do not have enough 4s in the gradebook.
#
# PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE HEADERS OF EACH SECTION.
# The text below each header, however, may be edited freely.
# Newlines within a comment will be read as spaces. To force a newline,
# use the escape character combination '\n'.
# Lines beginning with a '#' are comments and will be ignored
# by the sbgrader program.
# (Note, however, that this is not Python - sbgrader does not recognize
# multi-line comments within triple quotes.)
# You may also include certain numbers/variables to be calculated
# when the reports are generated. These variables are enclosed
# in {} brackets, such as {list_of_lts_below_standard}.
#
# The available variables are:
# {list_of_3s} -- a list of LTs on which the student has 3s,
#                 along with their brief descriptions.
#                 (e.g. "LT01: Completing the Square")
# {list_of_2s} -- list of LTs on which student has 2s
# list_of_0s_and_1s} -- list of LTs on which student has 0s or 1s
# {list_of_lts_below_standard} -- a list of learning targets on which
#                                 the student is not yet meeting standard.
# {min_4_count_for_A} -- a number equal to the number of LTs, divided by 2,
#                        and rounded up (Minimum number of 4s for an A).
# {min_count_of_lts_met_for_A} -- 90% of total LT count, rounded up
# {min_count_of_lts_met_for_B} -- 80% of total LT count, rounded up
# {min_count_of_lts_met_for_C} -- 65% of total LT count, rounded up
# {min_count_of_lts_met_for_D} -- 50% of total LT count, rounded up
# {total_lt_count} -- number of LTs in the gradebook
# {count_of_lts_met}
# {count_of_4s} -- number of 4s the student has earned
# {count_of_3s} -- number of 3s the student has earned
# {count_of_2s}
# {count_of_1s}
# {count_of_0s}
# {count_of_0s_and_1s}

def advice_for_A_with_all_LTs_met:
#    This function returns an advice string for the scenario where a student
#    is meeting all learning targets and qualifies for an A.
You currently have an A, which reflects excellent achievement in this class.
Keep working hard, and focus on studying the most recent material from class.


def advice_for_A_without_all_LTs_met:
#    This function returns an advice string for the scenario where a student
#    qualifies for an A but is not yet meeting standard on all
#    learning targets.
#    It takes as an argument a list of LearningTarget objects representing
#    LTs on which the student has earned 2.5 or below.
You currently have an A, which reflects excellent achievement in this class.
In order to make sure that you're building a strong foundation for future
classes, you should study the learning targets where you are not yet
meeting standard and try to deepen your understanding of those topics.\n\n
You are showing a developing level of understanding
on the following learning targets:\n
{list_of_lts_below_standard}


def advice_for_B_geq_90_pct:
#    This function returns a string for the scenario in which a student
#    is meeting more than 90% of the learning targets but has a B instead
#    of an A. This scenario occurs if and only if the student has 3s on
#    over 50% of the learning targets.
#
# For purposes of plurals, we may assume that there is more than one LT in
# the gradebook, since it is impossible to earn a B when there are fewer
# than five LTs.
You currently have a B, which means that your work in this class exceeds
expectations. You are meeting standard on more than 90% of the
learning targets. Currently, out of the {total_lt_count} learning targets
in the grade book, you are meeting standard (earning 3s) on {count_of_3s}
and exceeding standard (earning 4s) on an additional {count_of_4s}.\n
In order to raise your grade to an A, you need to exceed standard on
at least half of the learning targets, i.e. {min_4_count_for_A} of
the LTs.\n\n
You are meeting (but not yet exceeding) standard on the
following learning targets:\n
{list_of_3s}


def advice_for_B_under_90:
#    This function returns an advice string for the scenario in which a student
#    has a B and is not yet meeting 90% of learning targets.
You currently have a B, which means that your work in this class
exceeds expectations. Currently, out of the {total_lt_count} learning targets
in the grade book, you are meeting standard (earning 3s) on {count_of_3s}
and exceeding standard (4) on an additional {count_of_4s}.\n
In order to raise your grade to an A, you need to meet standard on 90%
(or {min_count_of_lts_met_for_A}) of the learning targets. You also need
to make sure that at least half of the learning targets
(at least {min_4_count_for_A} of the learning targets)
are at the 4 level (exceeding standard).\n\n
Your first priority should be to study the following learning targets
on which you are not yet meeting standard:\n
{list_of_2s}
\n\n
Your second priority should be to study learning targets on which you
are meeting (but not yet exceeding) standard:\n
{list_of_3s}


def advice_for_C_geq_80:
#    This function returns an advice string for the scenario in which a student
#    has a C in the course despite having passed over 80% of the LTs.
#    This scenario occurs if and only if a student has 0s or 1s in the
#    gradebook.
#
# We have to worry about plurals here. For now, deal with the ambiguity
# with the construction 'learning target(s)'
You currently have a C in this course, which means that your work in this
course is meeting expectations.\n
There are {count_of_0s_and_1s} learning target(s) on which you have
provided an incomplete response or on which there is no basis for assessment.
In order to raise your grade to an A or a B, you should focus on those
learning targets. As long as you have any 0s or 1s in the gradebook,
a C is the highest grade you can earn.\n\n
You should focus on studying the following learning targets:\n
{list_of_0s_and_1s}



def advice_for_C_under_80:
#    This function returns an advice string for the scenario in which
#    a student has a C because they are meeting between 65% and 79%
#    of learning targets.
You currently have a C in this course, which means that your work in
this course is meeting expectations.\n
Currently, out of the {total_lt_count} learning targets
in the grade book, you are meeting or exceeding
standard on {count_of_lts_met}.
In order to earn a B, you need to meet or exceed standard on at least 80%
of the learning targets (i.e. {min_count_of_lts_met_for_B} of the learning
targets).\n\n
You should focus on studying the following learning targets:\n"
{list_of_lts_below_standard}


def advice_for_D:
#    Advice for student who has a D.
You currently have a D, which means that your work in this course is not
yet satisfactory. In order to raise your grade to a C, you need to meet
or exceed standard on at least 65% of the learning targets
(i.e. {min_count_of_lts_met_for_C} of the learning targets)\n\n
You should focus on studying the following learning targets:\n"
{list_of_lts_below_standard}


def advice_for_F:
#    Advice for student who has an F.
Your grade is currently an F, which means you are not yet eligible for
credit for this course. In order to raise your grade to a D,
you need to meet or exceed standard on at least 50% of the learning targets
(i.e. {min_count_of_lts_met_for_D} of the learning targets).\n\n
You should focus on studying the following learning targets:\n
{list_of_lts_below_standard}


def advice_when_no_LTs_in_gradebook:
#    Advice for student who has an F simply because they have taken
#    no assessments.
Your grade is currently reported as an F. This is because there are no
assessment scores for you yet. You can expect your grade to change as soon
as you complete an assessment.
