# User Preferences
# Each user gets to set a few preferences:
#
# (1) FUNCTION:
# The preference 'function' may be set to 'simple', 'piecewise', or 'sticky'.
# 'Simple' means that all As are 95%, all Bs are 85%, all Cs are 75%,
#                     all Ds are 65%, and all Fs are 50%.
# 'Piecewise' means that the overall grade is calculated by the following
# piecewise function, where x is the percentage of learning targets met:
# f(x) = {x if x >= 0.8}, {(2x+0.8)/3 if x < 0.8}
#   with the added constraints that if the student does not have
#   at least 50% of LTs at 4s, the highest grade possible is .89,
#   and if the student has any 0s or 1s, the highest grade possible
#   is .79. 
# The idea of the piecewise function is to communicate progress
# within a letter grade.
# 'Sticky' looks at the grade that a student would receive under the 
# 'simple' or 'piecewise' functions and returns the lower of the two.
# Thus students see progress from (for example) 70% up to 75%, but then
# their grade sticks at 75% until they reach the B level.
# The idea of 'sticky' is to make it difficult for students to move
# up a letter grade based on other factors in the gradebook.
# For example, if a student's grade is based 90% on learning targets
# and 10% on a "mastery test" of skills from a previous course,
# the sticky function would make it difficult for the student to move
# from a B to an A based only on a high score on the mastery test. 
#
# (2) D_IS_VALID
# This should be set to True if the user works at a school that
# assigns Ds.
# If it is set to False, the program assumes that the only valid grades
# are A, B, C, and F.
#
# Other Notes:
# Feel free to delete all lines with other usernames.
# If only one username is in the file, the program will
# take that user as the default user.
#
# The preferences below are my (Dirks's) best guess at what you
# are using. Obviously feel free to change if I guessed incorrectly,
# and if you want more options, please let me know and I'll do my best
# to implement them.
